put your data here, or change the Vagrant/Docker config to point to
the location of your data. it will be mounted as /data in papino
virtual machine/container.

NOTE: if you have a lot of data and use Docker, it is best to put the data
      *outside* the papino root, otherwise it will be included in the docker
      images which will be shipped to the docker daemon and it will take ages
      before it starts.
